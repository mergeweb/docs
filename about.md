Welcome to the up&up front end best practices sites. This is where we document our best practices, helpful code snippets, and other development nuggets to help us save time, work together better, and make the world a better place.

We're using the Mark Otto's <a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com/">Hyde theme</a> for now. We should come up with a sweet design of our own to replace it that uses all of our best practices.
